# BulliQ 🎯  
**A darts performance, training, and checkout-intelligence platform**

BullIQ is a DartCounter-adjacent system designed to help darts players **win more legs**, not just record scores.

It focuses on:
- personalized checkout routes
- pressure-based practice
- deep but practical stats
- optional one-camera assist scoring

BullIQ does **not** integrate with or modify DartCounter.  
It runs alongside any scoring app or can be used standalone.
